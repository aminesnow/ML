# Machine Learning
This repo contains my attempts at various Machine Learning applications

## Working with:
- Octave examples of the Coursera "Machine Learning" course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learnin)
- Examples of NEAT genetic algorithm using the "NEAT-Python" library (https://neat-python.readthedocs.io)
