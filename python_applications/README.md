# Python applications of Machine Learning

This folder contains my applications of various machine learning algorithms to different problems that I find interesting to explore using Pyhton.

Algorithms used :
- NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) genetic algorithm
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks (DNN, CNN)
- Ensemble (Voting)
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)

Problems explored
- Predicting stock market prices
- Trading in the stock market for maximum returns
- Filtering spam mail
- MNIST Handwritten digits recognition
- Face detection
- Titanic survivor probabilty prediction (Kaggle)
- Credit default probabilty prediction (Kaggle)
